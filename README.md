# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications:  unhandled promise rejections within asynchronous request handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) lacks comprehensive error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code attempts an asynchronous operation. If the operation fails, no error is caught, resulting in silent failure. This makes debugging difficult. 

## Solution

The solution implements comprehensive error handling by utilizing a `catch` block to properly handle any rejected promises.  This prevents silent failures and provides a mechanism for handling errors gracefully, such as sending an appropriate error response to the client.
